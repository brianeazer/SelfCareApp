This application was created in part with Gfycat API and team members Mariah Hall, Brian Eazer, 
Michael Kincaid and Tae Kim for the October 2018 Grand Circus's Java Bootcamp Final Project.

Take Care is a self care web app for when you're feeling stressed or overwhelmed. It allows the user's to 
ground themselves using specific category types such as cats, nature and cartoons. In this project, we used
weighted probability to create a category for a user's specific likes and a SQL database to track a user's mood
data before, during and after looking at GIFs and to manipulate searched tags from the Gfycat API.
